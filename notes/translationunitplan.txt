Theoretically:
One per instance 

Instances are a vector of structs containing state, and bytecode, pc, etc 

And a shared call stack pair for external calls, which denotes vector index and pc of caller 

The current calling convention is for the args, then arg count to be pushed by the called function, then the VM in this case will forward those over to the stack of the other instance
