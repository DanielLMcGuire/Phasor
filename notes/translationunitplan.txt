Theoretically:
One per instance 

Instances are a vector of structs containing state, and bytecode, pc, etc 

For shared state, a shared call stack (pair of caller pc, and recipient of calls pc), and also current instance

The current calling convention is for the args, then arg count to be pushed by the called function, then the VM in this case will forward those over to the stack of the calling instance, and set the current instance back
